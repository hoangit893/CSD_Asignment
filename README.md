# CSD201x - Funix Asignment 1 
* Assignment 1's overview : 
- Build a program to perform sorting and searching on a series of real numbers. The program includes the following functions:
1. Enter a sequence of real numbers consisting of n numbers (n<=20) and save it to the file INPUT.TXT. The program allows the user to enter the length of the array stored in the variable n. Allows the user to enter the value of each element in the array. Data is stored in the array.
2. Read data from the INPUT.TXT file, save it to a 1-dimensional array a, and display the data from array a to the screen.
3. Sort array after reading data from step 2 in ascending order using Bubble Sort algorithm. Record the value of array a at each step of the algorithm to the file OUTPUT1.TXT (each step is written as 1 line in the file).
4. Sort array after reading data from step 2 in ascending order using Selection Sort algorithm. Record the value of array a at each step of the algorithm to the file OUTPUT2.TXT (each step is written as 1 line in the file).
5. Sort the array after reading the data from step 2 in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm. Record the value of array a at each step of the algorithm to the file OUTPUT3.TXT (each step is written as 1 line in the file).
6. Use the Linear Search method, print to the screen the positions of all elements with a value greater than value (value is a real number entered by the user) in the array a in step 2 ( unsorted array).
7. Use the Binary Search method, print to the screen the position of the first element whose value is equal to the value (value is a real number entered by the user) in array b (array b is array a after it has been sorted using one of the three algorithms in steps 3,4,5).
